# zombie_crush

A simple puzzle game I have created from scratch using the SDL2 library.

## controls

Use the MOUSE_LEFT key to select a zombie color and move it near a zombie of the same color.
If you form a row of at least 3 then the zombie will be eliminated.

## run

Run the code from terminal: it's required to insert some parameters

## requirements

SDL2 library 2.0.1

SDL_image library 2.0.5

my_functions library from https://github.com/AlbertoEusebio/my_functions.git
